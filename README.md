As innovation in drugs, treatments, etc. drastically increase lifespan, we've ignored health span! Many seniors want to maintain dignity by living independently, engaging with their communities, and still completing daily tasks. In fact, there are already 260 existing communities of independent senior citizens around the country called retirement villages. Even in our own New York City neighborhood, we have communities for senior citizens like Neighbor2Neighbor Greenwich Village.

However, these communities organize social events and volunteers inefficiently - often using disconnected applications like email and spreadsheets. That's why we created Neighbor, an easy to use system through Google Assistant which connects seniors to other seniors around them, as well as, volunteers in their community to assist them with daily activities like getting groceries, driving to the doctor appointments, etcetera. Crucially, this system is voice-enabled, to ensure that seniors who may not be comfortable with GUI's can still interface with everyone around them.

To use, open up an ngrok http on port 5000, and run the webhook.py file.
